This reusable library makes use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to read in user-given files containing text and create visualizations to highlight the data within the text. For each file given, this library analyzes the fileâ€™s text to extract data on word frequency, sentiment, average word length, number of words, and n-gram frequency (the value of n is determined by the user). Upon request, the library can then create six different visualizations illustrating the data collected. 

To see a demonstration of the functionality of this library, run reusable_nlp_app.py

To utilize this library, import the AnalyzeText class from the resuable_nlp.py file
